OE-prep-work: required software, read these:

  http://www.openembedded.org/index.php/Getting_started
  You don't need to download OpenEmbedded itself, it's included in this 
  release. This page will probably get you there the fastest:
  http://www.openembedded.org/index.php/OEandYourDistro

Getting started:

  # go to a base dir somewhere:
  # - as a reqular user (not root!)
  # - with lotsa space (25GB should be enough)
  # - fast, preferably not a (slow) network mount
  # - with no symlinks above it
  # - try to keep it short: OE will add plenty of depth before you're done :P
  cd /opt
  # Clone repo
  # go to workdir
  cd oe/qb2
  # set PATH + BBPATH vars (note the separate '.')
  . ../bb_env.sh
  # now we can get to work
  bitbake image-base-qb2
  # grab 144 cups of coffee, go for a manicure, mow the lawn, etc :)

After a lot of diskspace & CPU cycles this should yield:

  ls -l tmp/deploy/images/
  # qb2-base-rXX-YYYYMMDDHHIISS.rootfs.ubi.gz          ~ 12M
  # uImage-qb2-hae-2.6.36-rXX-hXX-YYYYMMDDHHIISS.bin   ~ 2M
  
  The sources dir should end up at ~ 2GB
  The qb2/tmp dir should end up at ~ 23GB

Known issues:

  - if Python says 'ImportError: No module named time', try 'ln -s lib.linux-i686-2.6 ../Python-2.6.6/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6'
  - to save some disk space usage try enabling 'INHERIT += "rm_work"' in qb2/conf/local.conf
  - if you have multiple cores, try modify 'BB_NUMBER_THREADS' in qb2/conf/local.conf
